# From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering: Everyone Can Now Build for Healthcare

### The most consequential shift in software is not about better developers. It is about removing the need to be one.

## 1. A Throwaway Tweet That Changed Everything

On a quiet February evening in 2025, Andrej Karpathy—co-founder of OpenAI, former head of AI at Tesla—fired off a stream of thoughts on X. He called it **"vibe coding"**:

> *"There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs are getting too good."*

He described barely touching the keyboard. He used voice input to say things like *"decrease the padding on the sidebar by half."* He clicked "Accept All" without reading the diffs. When errors appeared, he pasted them back in with no comment and waited for the model to self-correct.

The post was viewed over **4.5 million times**. Merriam-Webster listed it as slang in March 2025. Collins English Dictionary named it Word of the Year.

But Karpathy himself moved on quickly. By February 2026—exactly one year later—he declared vibe coding was already passé. The new term: **Agentic Engineering**.

> *"Programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming the default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny... 'Engineering' to emphasize that there is an art, science, and expertise to it."*

The distinction matters enormously for healthcare. Vibe coding was thrilling and chaotic. Agentic engineering is disciplined, structured, and—for the first time—safe enough to discuss seriously in clinical contexts.

## 2. The Numbers Behind the Shift

When Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, shared his personal workflow in December 2025, the industry stopped and listened. The stats were jaw-dropping:

- **259 pull requests** merged in a single month
- **497 commits**, 40,000 lines added, 38,000 lines removed
- **Every single line** written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5
- Claude ran autonomously for **minutes, hours, and sometimes days** at a time

He noted: *"Software engineering is changing, and we are entering a new period in coding history."*

This is not a hobbyist anecdote. At Anthropic, between **70% and 90% of all production code is now AI-generated**. Claude Code itself represents approximately **4% of all public GitHub commits** globally. Daily active users doubled in a single month.

The platform did not start as a grand vision. Cherny built the first version as a **side project in September 2024**. Less than 18 months later, it is the tool of choice for engineers at some of the world's most demanding organizations.

What strikes us at Yajur Healthcare is not just the productivity gain. It is what these platforms do for people who are *not* engineers.

## 3. Big Tech Has Already Connected the Dots

Analyst Aakash Gupta drew a sharp observation about OpenAI's acquisition pattern in early 2026:

> *"Altman just told you OpenAI's acquisition strategy and nobody is connecting the dots. 10 acquisitions in the last year."*

Two acquisitions stood out for their strategic pairing:
- **$3 billion for Windsurf** — an AI-native coding IDE
- **$100 million for Torch** — a healthcare AI company

These are not coincidental investments. They represent a calculated bet that the next wave of healthcare software will not be written by hospital IT teams working off decade-old specifications—it will be generated by domain experts who understand the problem, using tools that handle the implementation.

The implications for healthcare are significant. When the friction of software development collapses, the people closest to clinical problems become the most capable problem-solvers. A doctor who has spent twenty years watching patients fail to follow up on referrals does not need a six-month development sprint to prototype a solution. She can describe it, and an agentic system can build it.

## 4. What This Looks Like in Practice

The Replit CEO shared a case that has circulated widely in healthcare technology circles: a British doctor built a working health-tracking application for his patients for approximately **£200 (~₹21,000)**. No technical co-founder. No agency. No months of back-and-forth requirements documentation.

This is the pattern that matters. Non-technical domain experts—physicians, nurses, pharmacists, hospital administrators, insurance case managers—are beginning to build tools directly calibrated to their workflows. The outcomes of this shift are predictable:

**Patient engagement tools** built by the very clinicians who understand why patients disengage.

**Referral tracking systems** designed by coordinators who manually chase referrals today and know exactly where the process breaks.

**Medication adherence apps** created by pharmacists who have watched specific patient populations struggle with specific drug regimens.

**Triage decision aids** prototyped by emergency medicine physicians who have already mapped the decision tree in their heads.

**Claims pre-authorization workflows** designed by revenue cycle staff who know every payer's quirk.

None of these require a computer science degree. They require clinical and operational expertise—which already exists in abundance across the healthcare ecosystem. What was missing was the tool to translate that expertise into functional software. That tool now exists.

## 5. The Yajur Healthcare Perspective: Opportunity Meets Obligation

We have been thinking carefully about what this shift means for the infrastructure layer beneath healthcare software.

Enthusiasm is warranted. When a district-level nurse coordinator can prototype a home visit scheduling tool in an afternoon, and that tool integrates with ABDM to pull verified patient identifiers and push structured care records—that is transformative for primary healthcare delivery in India.

But the clinical AI failures we have documented in our earlier work are instructive. Models produce **plausible code faster than teams can validate it**. In one real-world deployment, an LLM misread a clinical eligibility rule and misclassified *"no steroid use in the last six weeks"* as *"recent steroid use stopped five days ago"*—an error with direct patient safety implications.

The lesson is not that AI-assisted development is unsafe. The lesson is that the **infrastructure around the AI** must be engineered with the same care as the model itself.

For healthcare specifically, this means:

**Data validation must be schema-aware.** A medication dose field that accepts free text is a liability. FHIR-compliant structured outputs are not a nice-to-have—they are the foundation on which clinical trust is built.

**Provenance must be traceable.** Every recommendation, every auto-populated field, every generated summary must carry a pointer back to the source. Auditability is not a compliance checkbox. It is how clinicians maintain oversight of AI-generated outputs.

**Ambiguity must surface, not be hidden.** Agentic systems that quietly guess when data is missing are dangerous in clinical contexts. The pipeline must flag uncertainty and escalate appropriately.

**Human-in-the-loop is a design principle, not a fallback.** The most effective deployments we have seen treat clinician review not as an exception path but as the default confirmation step for consequential decisions.

This is the gap that Yajur Healthcare exists to address. As coding platforms lower the barrier to building, we focus on raising the quality of the clinical context those tools operate within—structured pipelines, validated outputs, contextual AI that understands the difference between a lab value from this morning and one from three years ago.

## 6. India's Compounding Advantage

The timing of this shift intersects with a unique moment for Indian healthcare.

The ABDM network is maturing. NHCX is beginning to digitize the claims ecosystem. UHI is creating a discovery layer for health services. These are not isolated pilots—they are network-scale infrastructure investments that, for the first time, give any developer—technical or clinical—a common data fabric to build on.

India also has an extraordinary pipeline of STEM graduates, multilingual clinical annotators, and domain experts across oncology, primary care, mental health, and chronic disease management who understand the local care delivery context in ways that no offshore team ever will.

When you combine:
- AI coding platforms that enable domain experts to build
- National health infrastructure (ABDM, NHCX, UHI) that provides structured interoperability
- A large, multilingual clinical workforce that understands local context
- A data infrastructure company (Yajur Healthcare) that engineers the clinical reasoning layer

You get something genuinely new: a healthcare software ecosystem that is built from the inside out—by the people who deliver care—rather than from the outside in, by technologists who must be taught what care actually looks like.

## 7. What We Are Watching

The platforms will continue to improve. Karpathy's evolution from vibe coding to agentic engineering within a single year signals how fast the paradigm is moving. Boris Cherny's prediction that software engineering as a title will transform—not disappear—points toward a future where clinical and technical expertise merge in practitioners we don't yet have names for.

We are paying close attention to:

- **Healthcare-specific coding environments** that understand FHIR schemas, ICD-10 hierarchies, and ABDM APIs natively
- **Agentic workflows** that can handle the multi-step complexity of clinical processes—prior authorization, care coordination, discharge planning—not just isolated data entry
- **Evaluation frameworks** for AI-generated healthcare software that go beyond functional testing to include clinical safety, data privacy (DPDP Act compliance), and interoperability validation
- **The regulatory posture** of agencies like NHA and CDSCO as clinician-built software begins entering procurement pipelines

## A Closing Thought

Healthcare has always suffered from a translation problem. The people who know what patients need cannot build the tools. The people who can build the tools cannot know what patients need.

AI coding platforms are dissolving that barrier. What replaces it—the quality of the clinical context, the rigor of the infrastructure, the discipline of the engineering—is the work that remains. It is the work Yajur Healthcare was built to do.

The tools are ready. The question is whether the ecosystem around them is ready too.
